                    <h4>Vickrey auction</h4>
                    <p>This is identical to the sealed first-price auction except that the winning bidder pays the second-highest bid rather than his or her own.</p>

                    <h4>Sealed first-price auction</h4>
                    <p>In this type of auction all bidders simultaneously submit sealed bids so that no bidder knows the bid of any other participantы</p>
